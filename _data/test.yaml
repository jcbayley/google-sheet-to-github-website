  WESBITE: 'https://www.campaigncc.org/'
  AIMS/ABOUT: >-
    Campaign Aims and Objectives - The Campaign against Climate Change (CCC)
    exists to push for the urgent and radical action we need to prevent the
    catastrophic destabilisation of global climate. The destabilisation of
    global climate has become the very greatest threat to our planet and
    everyone on it – with the possible exception only of all-out war with modern
    weapons of mass-destruction. We do not know how much irreversible damage we
    have done already but we know that if we do not act now the effects will be
    many times more devastating still. 1. The CCC exists to secure the action we
    need - at a local, national and, above all, international level - to
    minimise harmful climate change and the devastating impacts it will have. To
    that end the CCC seeks to raise awareness about the gravity and urgency of
    the threat from climate change and to influence those with the greatest
    power to take effective action to do so with the utmost speed and
    resolution. Where ignorance, short term greed and vested interests stand in
    the way of the action that is urgently needed, the CCC exists to fight
    against all of these things. 2. In particular the CCC brings people together
    for street demonstrations, designed to get together the greatest number of
    people possible, and to create a mass movement to push for our goals. 3. The
    CCC seeks a global solution to a global problem and aims to push for an
    international emissions reductions treaty that is both effective in
    preventing the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate and equitable
    in the means of so doing. To be effective such a treaty needs to secure such
    reductions in the global total of greenhouse gas emissions as are deemed by
    the broad consensus of qualified scientific opinion to be necessary to
    prevent harmful climate change. The CCC aims to campaign against those with
    the greatest responsibility for preventing or delaying the progress we
    urgently need towards an international climate treaty. 4. The CCC recognises
    that the issue of the destabilisation of global climate has enormous
    implications in terms of social justice and global inequality. The damage to
    the earth’s atmosphere has so far been done mainly by the rich nations but
    it is the poorest who will suffer the greatest and most immediately. The CCC
    recognises that any solution to the problem must be as fair as possible,
    incorporating principles of social justice and not exacerbating global
    inequalities. 5. The CCC aims to bring together as many people as possible
    who support our broad aims of pushing for urgent action on climate and
    reducing global emissions. The CCC does not therefore campaign on the
    important but more detailed questions of how best to achieve these emission
    reductions and recognises that supporters will have different and deeply
    held views on these issues.

    Solidarity Against Neoliberal Extremism (S.A.N.E.) Collective is a nascent
    social movement concerned about the destructive and corrosive nature of
    neoliberalism. SANE aims to link activists across the broadest possible
    range of social and environmental issues and orgs. to create actions and
    interactions that challenge the foundations of neoliberal capitalist ‘common
    sense’. By reclaiming civic space and rejuvenating critical civic activism
    SANE members look to play an active role in the global movement for social,
    economic and environmental justice, in fact for system change. The SANE
    Collective is an informal grouping of politically aligned and non-aligned
    individuals and group who want to create real democracy practices,
    initiating new forms of critical activism and supporting others which
    already exist. Principles of solidarity, inclusion, transparency and "power
    with not power over" are central to the way SANE works. Look out for a SANE
    event near you or propose an action or interaction we should support.

    Ember’s roots go back to 2008, when Baroness Bryony Worthington saw the
    desperate need to shine a light on the malfunctioning EU carbon market.
    Founded as Sandbag Climate Campaign, we enabled the public to buy and remove
    the surplus carbon allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
    Recognising the systemic problems with the carbon market, we quickly
    transitioned into data-driven policy advocacy, aiming to win reform of this
    crucial climate policy. After more than a decade working to reform and
    improve the EU carbon market, the team’s focus has shifted, and since
    October last year, all six of our analysts have been working full-time on
    coal phase-out.
